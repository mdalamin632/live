                    <p>When I downloaded this app half a year ago it worked great! It captured kyrillic letters from screenshots and turned them into a text file, which I could then copy and paste into a translation app. No longer works like this! It turns the kyrillic characters into gibberish of latin letters and numbers, thus impossible to translate. I have found no way of updating it, in fact I believe the updates have caused this. It worked great a few months ago! Why not now?</p>
